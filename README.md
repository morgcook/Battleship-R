# Battleship-R
My final project for MATH 100 "Data Driven Decision Making." My professor allowed me to create a programming project rather than a statistical analysis, resulting in this version of Battleship with R and the base R graphics package. This includes an AI computer opponent, which uses a probabilistic hunt/target algorithm to decide its moves.

It had to be made in a relatively short span of time, so the code and function names are somewhat unintuitive. It uses console input from the user in the form of "A1" to determine the user's move, and I recommend running the program in RStudio.
